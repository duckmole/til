# My first step in elm

## Installation

Install the langage and a test framework:

 * Install [elm](http://elm-lang.org/install)
 * Install elm-test with the command line `npm install -g elm-test`. You should install npm if you do not have it

It's not a good point that there is NO test framework included. In 2016, I think, it not a opinion.

 * Install your favorite editor emacs [elm-mode](https://github.com/jcollard/elm-mode)


## Start coding

Now with could start coding :

 * in your working directory `elm-test init` this adds the [Elm-Test](https://github.com/deadfoxygrandpa/Elm-Test) dependency and creates TestRunner.elm and Tests.elm.
 * and run the tests with `elm-test tests/TestRunner.elm`
